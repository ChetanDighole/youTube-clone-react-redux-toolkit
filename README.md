# Youtube clone
The YouTube clone is a front-end application created with React and Redux Toolkit that includes a search feature utilizing the YouTube API to fetch real-time data. When a video is clicked, it opens in a new page and react-router-dom library is employed for page navigation. Additionally, each video comes with a LIVE chat support system that is implemented using API poling technique, and there is a nested comment section for every video. Tailwind CSS serves as the chosen CSS framework, and in case data doesn't load, Shimmer UI is also utilized.
